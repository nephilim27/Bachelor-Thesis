            <h3>Step 1 </h3>
            Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large skillet on medium-high. Season salmon with ½ teaspoon each salt and pepper, add to skillet, flesh side down, reduce heat to medium, and cook until golden brown and just opaque throughout, 5 to 6 minutes per side. <br /> 
            <h3>Step 2 </h3>
            Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large cast-iron skillet on medium-high. Add green beans and cook until browned, 2½ minutes. Turn with tongs and cook until browned and just barely tender, about 3 minutes more. <br />
            <h3>Step 3 </h3>
            Remove from heat and toss with ¼ teaspoon salt, then garlic, chile, and capers. Return to medium heat and cook, tossing until garlic is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with salmon and lemon wedges if desired. <br />
